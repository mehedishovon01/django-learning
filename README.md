# Project Setup

To use this project to your own machine follow this steps

### Clone repository from github

First of all, clone this repository using this command

    git clone https://github.com/mehedishovon01/django-learning.git

### Create a virtualenv

Make a virtual environment to your project directory. Let's do this,

If you have already an existing python3 virtualenv then run this

    virtualenv venv

Or if virtualenv is not install in you machine then run this

Activate the virtual environment and verify it

    . venv/bin/activate

### Install the dependencies

Most of the projects have dependency name like requirements.txt file which specifies the requirements of that project, so let’s install the requirements of it from the file.

# Database Configuration

I am using `MySQL` database here. To configure MySQL in your Django project, you'll need to update the `DATABASES` setting in your settings.py file as follows:

    'default': {  
    'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',  
    'NAME': 'django_learning',  
    'USER': 'root',  
    'PASSWORD': 'WrongPass01@',  
    'HOST': '127.0.0.1',  
    'PORT': '3306',  
    'OPTIONS': {  
        'init_command': "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'"  
        }
    }
